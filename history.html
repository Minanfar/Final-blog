            In the first installment of Assassin’s Creed, Desmond Miles voiced
            by Nolan North wakes up in a laboratory inside the Animus, which is
            a machine that allows him to relive the memories of his ancestor. He
            confronts the man responsible for bringing him to the Animus, only
            to be blackmailed by Vidic (Phil Proctor) for information only
            obtained by reliving the life of Altair. When Desmond enters the
            Animus, he begins Altair’s story of retrieving the golden orb. When
            he fails his mission, his rank and weapons are taken from him. In
            order to reclaim his original title, he is sent on a mission to
            assassinate nine members of the Templar organization. Along the way,
            Altair must also collect data on each of the targets and report
            back. Desmond is allowed some rest in between the trails of Altair,
            where he becomes immensely close with Dr. Vidic’s assistant, Lucy
            Stillman who is voiced by Kristen Bell. In these brief breaks,
            Desmond learns about modern-day Templars and what they are after.

            In this second installment in the Assassin’s Creed Saga, Desmond is
            training to be a modern-day assassin with the help from another past
            ancestor. The Animus inserts into the memories of Ezio. Ezio’s story
            begins during the 15th century Renaissance. He watches as his father
            and brothers are hung. Following that, he escapes the city and heads
            toward his uncle Mario’s villa. During Ezio quest for revenge, he
            gains a few allies: one being the legendary Leonardo de Vinci. De
            Vinci enhance many of the assassin tools Ezio took from his father
            using schematics found in Altair’s Codex pages. Desmond and Dr.
            Vidic run into a bit of a roadblock when they discover that parts of
            Ezio memories are being protected and are unable to be detected by
            Animus.

            Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca, and the rest of the gang set up camp in the
            ruins of the Villa Auditore. Once they are safe in hiding from the

            to be killed by Cesare. Cesare takes the Apple for himself and the
            Templars. After the loss of his uncle, Ezio set out to restore Rome
            to its former glory by assassinating key players in Cesare’s
            organizing and sabotaging his resources. Ezio eventually recovers

            In this installment of the Assassin’s Creed Saga, you see all three
            of the major characters as of now: Altair, Ezio, and Desmond. Ezio
            travels to 1511 A.D. Constantinople. Constantinople is divided into
            four districts: Constantine, Bayezid, Imperial, and Galata. The
            Templars completely populate the majority of the underground city of
            Cappadocia, which is where Ezio begins this journey. While in
            Cappadocia, Ezio finds out that Altair has sealed an ancient
            artifact that could end he Templars forever. Ezio uses the relics of
            the First Civilization to relive Altair’s memories and experiences
            just like Desmond has been doing. In the present day, though,
            Desmond is trapped inside of the Animus 2.0. He finds a safe mode
            called the Black Room where he must find a key memory that will link
            him back up with Altair and Ezio and wake him from his comatose
            state.

            This fifth addition to the epic saga is set in 18th century America
            during the American Revolution. Assassin’s Creed III introduced a
            new character, Ratonhnhake:ton, also known as Connor. Connor’s
            father is the Grand Master of the Templar Order in the colonies.
            Directly after the events of Revelations, Desmond and his gang find
            the Temple of the First Civilization in New York. Using the Apple of
            Eden, they are able to gain access to it. Juno influence causes
            Desmond to experience the life of Haytham Kenway in 1754 England
            once he reenters Animus. While inside his ancestor’s memories,
            Desmond learns that the Key does not open the Temple itself. Once
            Ratonhnhake:ton (Conner) is born, the perspective does switch from
            Haytham to him. You learn how he became an assassin and of his
            trials and kills.

            You would think that Desmond dying would be the end of Absergo using
            him for information about his ancestors, but it is not. They take
            samples from Desmond’s corpse that allow them to continue searching
            his memories using the Animus’ cloud computing abilities. Absergo
            then hires someone that can look into the memories and relive the
            life of Edward Kenway. Edward Kenway was an 18th century pirate and
            grandfather of Conner from the previous game. He uncovers a plot
            between Templars in the British and Spanish empires. They tend to
            use their positions of power to pinpoint the Sage. The Sage is the
            only person that can lead them to the Observatory, which is a First
            Civilization device that can be used to spy on anyone anywhere. By
            accidentally killing Duncan, Edward is thrust into the
            Templar-Assassin society.

            in the North Atlantic chapter, he meets another assassin that goes
            by the name of Adewale. Adewale brings devastating news of an
            earthquake that destroyed Port-au-Prince. Shay is then recruited to
            investigate the Templar’s interest in the Precursor artifact and
            manuscript that are linked to the temple that so happened to be in
            Port-au-Prince. Shay then impersonates a Templar courier and
            delivers the artifact to Benjamin Franklin that is voiced by Rick
            Jones. Benjamin experiments with electricity generate a map that
            shows all the locations of the Precursor temples. A temple in Lisbon
            holds the Piece of Eden. Shay is sent to retrieve it. However, once
            he learns of the danger involved with retrieving a Piece of Eden, he
            decides to forgo the mission and steal the manuscript so no more
            destruction can happen. The Brotherhood catch him, though and shoot
            him before he can destroy the manuscript.

            flash forward to de Molay’s death and him cursing King Phillip IV
            and Pope Clement V. In the present time, Bishop, a member of the
            modern-day Assassin Brotherhood, takes control of the memory. The
            memory moves forward to Versailles in 1776. In this memory, Arno
            Dorian meets Elise De La Serre. She is the daughter of the Templar
            Grand Master. After this the story skips forwards to Arno sneaking
            into a party to meet with Elise. When he sneaks out, he finds the
            Grand Master murdered and is mistaken as the killer. After he
            escapes from his prison cell, he returns home to Elise only to be
